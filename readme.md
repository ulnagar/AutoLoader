# AutoLoader

AutoLoader is intended to be a project that uses the Google YouTube API to search for videos using a particular keyword. It then compares the videos found to the videos in a playlist, and adds them to the playlist if they do not already exist.

This should be run periodically (e.g. every 2 hours) to ensure that the playlist is as up-to-date as possible.
